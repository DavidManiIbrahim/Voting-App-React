        <p class="lead">An Online voting system that will replace the old balot
        paper system. Over the time we have utilized the required 
        technology in every sector to improve efficiency and save the 
           extra resources. But the votig systemis still very
           expensive and requires bigger workforce. The system is slower 
           and still not completely tamper proof. We bring the system that 
           is safe, reliable and solve the modern issues like higher 
           reachability of the booth, the crowd free voting, inexpensive,
           faster results and others.
